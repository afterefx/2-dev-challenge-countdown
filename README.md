# TickTock Flop Clock
![Workflow result](https://github.com/afterefx/2-dev-challenge-countdown/workflows/Check/badge.svg)


## :scroll: Description
A countdown clock that turned out to be much hard than I imagined. Inspired by 
[this](https://codepen.io/maneeshc/pen/jrMpwg) codepen that I came across, I set out to recreate it.
The most difficult part was the animations of course. Still a few kinks to work out, but ran out of
time.


## :bulb: Motivation and Context
Browsing [clock shop](https://drawcall.github.io/clock-shop/) found [this](https://codepen.io/maneeshc/pen/jrMpwg)
as inspiration. I'm very proud that flaps flip.
